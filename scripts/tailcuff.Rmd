## Procedural outline
Turn on machines / heaters. Put mice in tailcuff room and let the room and mice acclimate to appropriate temperature for ~30-60 mins. Then, check cuffs for leaks. Put mice into restraints, and perform 5 acclimation cycles + 20 recorded cycles. Save your data to a thumb drive.

When placing mice into restraints,  
1. Quickly place nose cuff on to avoid letting them turn around/upside in the restraint
2. Make sure that you can see them breathing...  
3. Maximize tightness of fit *and* breathing
