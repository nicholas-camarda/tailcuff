## Procedural outline
Turn on machines / heaters. Put mice in tailcuff room and let the room and mice acclimate to appropriate temperature for ~30-60 mins. Then, check cuffs for leaks. Put mice into restraints, and perform 5 acclimation cycles + 20 recorded cycles. Save your data to a thumb drive.

When placing mice into restraints,  
1. Quickly place nose cuff on to avoid letting them turn around/upside in the restraint
2. Make sure that you can see them breathing...  
3. Maximize tightness of fit *and* breathing 


## Run *process-data.R* first!
Be sure to fill in the proper Phases for each date in the excel spreadsheet and save it as an excel file with the proper extension *my_data.xlsx* in the folder *output/cleaned-data*


## Fill in the proper paths in *exec.R*

## Then hit Shift+Cmd+K :)

```{r load, echo=TRUE,message=TRUE,warning=FALSE}
# set knitr chunk options
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, 
                      warning = FALSE, results = "asis", fig.width = 10, fig.height = 8)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(root.dir=normalizePath(file.path(getwd(), "../")))
getwd()


```
